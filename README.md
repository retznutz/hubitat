# hubitat
Hubitat apps and drivers.

Added in "Switch" as a capability and on/off commands with the updated "start" command for the VOC API. You know, for voice controlled systems :) Call your device My Volvo, then say "Alexa, turn on my Volvo". As always, please be aware of the security risks this may have and make sure your network is firewalled properly.
